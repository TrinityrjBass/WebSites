	<h2>Finding the English</h2>
	  <p>
	  The Korean language is pretty easy to read once you know the alphabet, but that takes time and there are many other 
	  websites that focus on that. Some people that come to Korea do not have time, make time or take the time to learn the 
	  language and they can find food just fine each and every day. 
      This is because many of the foods (fortunately) have some English printed on them. As this picture shows.<br />
	  <img alt="Active Dry Yeast" src="images/yeast.jpg" width="300" height="400"><br />
      If you look closely under the purple banner the you can see the label in English.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, this is not the case for all foods.<br/>
      <a href="images/meat.jpg"><img id="nofloat" alt="meat" src="images/meatS.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a><br />
      Using our keen eyesight (click the image for a larger image) we can see that there are pictures 
      of the product on the packaging and looking closely, we can see that 
      the center cans have some English on them. This looks like a wall
      of canned meat (SPAM) because it is. There is some history there.
      </p>

    <h2>No English, No Problem</h2>
      <p>As I stated above, many products have pictures that can be used to identify the contents.
      This is not always the case. Take the package of yeast for example. If I was asked to guess the contents just by the picture I would 
      be stumped since the picture contains both pastries and yeast bread.
      <br/>
      A list of common ingredients:
      </p>
     <h3>Flour</h3>

******************  notes on project  ****************** 
I would have liked to change the format of the pages with lots of pictures (equipment.html and food.html) but it was more of a project than I thought it was going to be and time was running out.

I added a box-shadow to the images because I used a picture from my wifes blog and the effect came with the picture. I liked it and thought to make all the pictures look similar, thinking that I could make a class or id that takes the effect away for that one image so there wasn't a double shadow. For some reason it didn't work and I couldn't figure out why.

Another problem that I had was to add the margin-right to the picture on the about.html page. The style that added a right margin was in the same block as the style that made it float left, but only the float left style was showing.

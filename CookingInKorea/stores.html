	    <h2>Homeplus</h2>
	    <p>As I understand it, Home Plus is owned by a British company called TESCO and carry 
		many Western (ok, English) food items. The larger Homeplus stores sell clothes, electronics, toys and food.
		They are pretty popular in South Korea so I reccommend finding the nearest one pretty much as 
		soon as you can.</p>
		
		<h2>Emart</h2>
		<p>Korean-based, similar to Homeplus, also very handy to know the closest one for the same reasons.</p>
		
	    <h2>Daiso</h2>
		<p>Japanese import store... also: really cool dollar store, that are usually found in places where there are other businesses or lots of foot traffic.</p>
		
		<h2>Costco</h2>
		<p>Few and far between, unless you are very lucky you will have to take public transit to get to the nearest one.</p>
		<p>Costco requires a yearly membership fee of about $30.00 (30,000 - 35,000 Korean won). On the bright side, if you already have a membership you do not need to make a new account.</p>		
		<p>Costco is also the best place to buy familiar cuts of meat, canned foods, and frozen foods.</p>

		<h2>Going local</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Homeplus Express</li>
		    <li>Emart Everyday</li>
			<li>Other local grocery stores</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
		  Both Emart and Homeplus have a chain of small grocery stores that are also pretty common. Homeplus has
		  Homeplus Express and Emart has Emart Everyday. There are also local grocery stores that may or may not be part of a chain. 
		  Even in the middle of Sebookoul (the capital of South Korea) there will most likely be a grocery store that is within
		  walking distance of your house. There are 3 by mine.
		  </p>
		  		
		<h2 id="onlinestores">Online Shopping</h2> 
		<ul>
		  <li>Gmarket</li>
		  <li>iHerb</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Almost anything can be found on Gmarket, unfortunately the English version does not have as big as a selection as the Korean version.
		<br/>
		What can't be found on Gmarket (regarding food), can be found on iHerb. iHerb has lots of organic and free trade items for a resonable price especially for shipping to Korea.
		It can be a life saver when you really want/need REAL oatmeal, coffee, grits ect.<br/>
